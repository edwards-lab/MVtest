MVTest is written and maintained by Eric Torstenson
<eric.s.torstenson@vanderbilt.edu> based on the algorithm developed by Todd
Edwards <todd.l.edwards@vanderbilt> and Chun Li <cxl791@case.edu>.

Much of the command line interface is mimicks that of PLINK
http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/ in order to make it easy for
researchers to be able to quickly integrate MVTest into their workflow.
